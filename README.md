# hex_tiny & hex_beefy


* **hex_tiny** is a single image containing "repository" functionality of private hex repos. It is as if you followed [Hex: Self Hosting](https://hex.pm/docs/self-hosting) and containerized it.
* **hex_beefy** is a single image containing [hexpm/hexpm](https://github.com/hexpm/hexpm/tree/main) running in a **test** environment, with an internal postgres already set up.


--------
### Use Case

I needed this to use as a reference API implementation to execute against (because testing against Hex.pm itself is rude).
